You agree to provide, in case we demand, a notarized identification, or any other certified identification per the applicable laws of your jurisdiction. If such notarized or certified identification is not provided within five (5) days of our request, then such refund or reverse transaction shall not be effected, Your Player Account shall be closed and You shall forfeit all funds in Your Player Account, such decision shall be final, binding and not subject to appeal.

If your withdrawals exceed the total amount deposited, any excess amount will be paid to you via one of our alternative methods available in the cashier.




	\u2022	If any credit card purchases are considered to carry an unacceptable risk for security or legal reasons either by our credit card processors or by our betting managers, the operator will initiate refunds for all such transactions back to the credit card, and notify all the appropriate authorities and parties.
	\u2022	If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with our services and request to issue a refund for the balance currently held in your account. Before a refund is processed all bonuses and winnings in your balance will be deducted before calculating the amount to be refunded.
